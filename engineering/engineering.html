        <p>I am a fourth-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Please check out my <a href="https://saharama.github.io/">Techfolio</a> for more detailed information on my technical projects.<p>
        <p>I was a part of Dr. Yingfei Dong's Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) for my EEx96. As a sophomore, I used Kali Linux to learn and test Wi-Fi penetration techniques, in regards to different flaws in encryption and network protocol. We then applied wireless penetration and traffic analysis techniques to UAS. For my senior project, we used Python to produce statistics and analyze trends in wireless network-based drone communication, and we were able to successfully distinguish two drones based on trends in their respective network communication. I now serve as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for Dr. Dong, where we continue to analyze trends and determine the unique "wireless fingerprint" of different drones. In the future, we hope that this will help with ethical and efficient drone neutralization techniques.</p>
        <p>In addition to network security, I am also very interested in RF/Microwave Circuit design. I am currently part of the Liquid Metal - Vertically Integrated Project. In Fall 2019, I worked as a part of the RF Circuits team which focused on the design, fabrication, and test of radio-frequency (RF) microstrip transmission line devices, utilizing the advantages of liquid metal. Starting in Spring 2020, I have been working on the Liquid Metal Tunable Inductor project. I have signed a non-disclosure agreement, so I may not be able to provide too many details when discussing this project. </p>
